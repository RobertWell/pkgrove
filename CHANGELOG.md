# Changelog

All notable changes to RowRelay. Pre-stable: breaking changes may occur in any
0.x release and are listed here with migration notes.

## 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT (unreleased)

HEL-126 selectable transaction policies:

- Typed `TransactionPolicy` (Atomic / Chunked / SavepointPerBatch /
  JoinExisting / AutoCommit) executed by `TransactionalWriter`, returning a
  machine-readable `TransactionOutcome` (state, committed/rolled-back rows,
  chunk ranges, checkpoint, `RetrySafety`) — partial completion cannot be
  mistaken for success. Caller-owned transactions are never committed/closed;
  unsupported combinations fail before any row is processed. Adapters report
  `supportsSavepoints` (Oracle yes, DuckDB JDBC no). See docs/TRANSACTIONS.md
  for the cross-database no-global-atomicity boundary and scheduler rules.


HEL-119 named transfer (added after the initial bootstrap):

- `NamedSql` (rowrelay-jdbc): `:user_name` parameters for the direct JDBC
  path — state-aware parsing (literals/quoted identifiers/comments/`::`),
  repeated names, exact missing-name rejection, unused-parameter policies;
  positional binding remains as the low-level compatibility form.
- `Mapping` / `MappingPlan` (rowrelay-transfer): named source-to-target
  mapping with renames, constants, omissions; case-insensitive, validated
  before writing, order-independent, inspectable plan.
- Explicit named-key upsert: `Transfer.Options.upsertKeys` → Oracle `MERGE` /
  DuckDB `ON CONFLICT` (target uniqueness on keys required).
- Three defects caught BY the live-Oracle suite and fixed:
  Oracle vendor type codes (-101/-102 TZ timestamps, 100/101 binary
  float/double) now classify correctly; a deterministic identifier-case
  policy (`SqlDialect.identifierCase`, Oracle = uppercase-then-quote) makes
  generated DDL/DML match unquoted-created objects; temporal columns take
  JDBC-standard type names from the type CODE so Oracle's datetime-valued
  DATE columns cannot silently lose their time component in a date-only
  target.
- Live-Oracle integration suite (testcontainers, auto-skipped without
  Docker): both directions, both access paths, type fidelity incl.
  NVARCHAR2 unicode, CLOB with literal colons, BLOB/RAW bytes, TZ
  timestamps, and all-null rows.


Initial capability set, extracted from production code in AuditPatchX and
QuerySkiff (see the HEL-120 pilot — behavior parity proven by the consumer's
own integration suite, 135/135):

- `rowrelay-core`: dynamic `Schema`/`Row`/`RowBatch` model, `DataWarning`
  (nothing lossy is silent), `ConversionPolicy` (REJECT default),
  `CancelToken`, no-echo safe-identifier gate, `OperationReport` with
  failed-batch/row-range identification.
- `rowrelay-jdbc`: streaming parameterized reads with bounded memory,
  schema discovery without DTOs, `ValueReader` normalization seam,
  batch writer with AllOrNothing / PerChunk commit policies,
  `SqlDialect` contract.
- `rowrelay-jdbi`: first-class JDBI entry point; equivalence with the JDBC
  path by construction; caller-owned-transaction semantics (never commits
  inside your transaction; rejects PerChunk there).
- `rowrelay-oracle`: Oracle dialect (NUMBER p/s, VARCHAR2→CLOB overflow,
  NUMBER(1) boolean, RAW/BLOB by size, TZ-aware temporals) +
  `OracleValueReader` normalizing `oracle.sql.*`.
- `rowrelay-duckdb`: DuckDB dialect incl. java.time→java.sql bind adaptation.
- `rowrelay-transfer`: bidirectional SQL-in/data-out engine with target
  modes, conversion policies, bounded memory, honest partial reports.

Renamed from the internal working name `datakit`
(`internal.datakit:*` coordinates are dead; migrate imports
`datakit.*` → `io.maxxga.rowrelay.*`).
